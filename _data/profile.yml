  <p>
    I am a Co-founder and AI Scientist at ZEAI, where I am primarily responsible for the AI research and technical development.
    My research interests lie in computer vision, multimodal learning, and generative AI.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am particularly interested in text-driven storybook generation, with a focus on maintaining character consistency and narrative coherence across multiple scenes and pages.
    My current work explores how to integrate vision–language models, generative models, and structured narrative representations to enable controllable and coherent multimodal content generation.
